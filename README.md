    PREFIX_COMMANDS: {
    ENABLED: true, // Enable/Disable prefix commands
    DEFAULT_PREFIX: "?", // Default prefix for the bot
    }
   ```
- Commands to run in the console (after filling out the config.js file)
  - `npm i` && `npm i discord.js` these commands will install all the dependencies required for this code. (make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your device)
    - after all the dependencies have been installed you will see the `node_modules` folder.
      - then run `node .`

~ _thats it. now you can edit the code as you like_
- __**NOTE :__ this isn't an exact clone of the bot falcon this is just to make the commands similar to it. the interface isnt exactly the same**
